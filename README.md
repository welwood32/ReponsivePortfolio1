Homework 2- Responsive Portfolio 

I have created a site that is reactive with different screen sizes and devices. I utilized bootstrap to render and build my portfolio with a navbar, hamburger style drop down menu, cards and footer. I linked all pages with appropriate tags and ensured all links properly take you to the desired page. I made sure to add semantic tags to help ease reading and understanding the HTML. I also applied some personalization to the site to better express myself. I tried to use inline style as much as possible and avoid CSS. The images are link via assets/images folder.
